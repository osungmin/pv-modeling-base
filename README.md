This repository contains the core scripts used for our PV (photovoltaic) modeling workflow.  
It includes:

- Data preparation and cleaning  
- Irradiance and temperature preprocessing  
- Feature engineering for PV performance modeling  
- Baseline PV prediction and evaluation scripts  

These scripts serve as the foundation for subsequent experiments and paper-specific analyses.
